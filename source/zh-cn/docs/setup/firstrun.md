- Click `Yes`,then your workspace will be created in a new folder "lemonce" (the default path: Users\Username\Documents).
- Click `No`,the workspace will still be created automatically when you create a test case in Case Editor.

The workspace consists of two parts: 

- The configuration file "lemonce.json", which is used to store the overall properties of the workspace. 
- By default, Lemonce Editor will automatically create the configuration file, which creates a working directory "/lemonce". According to the needs of the work space can be set in a separate empty directory. 

If the project development permits, you can also configure the workspace in the project directory to be involved in the development process.
