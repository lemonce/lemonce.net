View bar is located on the far left-hand side including three buttons to switch the view of Side bar, which can assist you while working on your project.

#### 2.1 <i class="fa fa-code fa-2x"></i> **Explore**  

The Explorer is used to browse, open, and manage all of the files and folders in your project. You can click the button <span class="button"> open folder</span> under the label **NO WORKSPCACE** to open a folder as workspace at the first time.

After opening a folder in Lemonce, the contents of the folder are shown in the Explorer. You can do many things by right-click from here:
- Create, delete, and rename files and folders.
- Open the existed cases/folders in file explorer.
- `Move files and folders with drag and drop.`
- `Use the context menu to explore all options.`

**2.1.1 OPEN EDITORS** 

There are three buttons to toggle different areas of editor groups, you can find more detailed information in [Code Editor](docs/code-editor/index.html)

At the top of the Explorer is a section labeled **OPEN EDITORS**. This is a list of active files or previews. These are files you previously opened in Lemonce that you're working on. For example, a file will be listed in the **OPEN EDITORS** section if you:

- Make a change to a file.
- Double-click a file's header.
- Double-click a file in the Explorer.
- Open a file that is not part of the current folder.

Just click an item in the OPEN EDITORS section, and it becomes active in Lemonce.

Once you are done with your task, you can remove but not delete files seperately from the OPEN EDITORS section by click <i class="fa fa-times"></i>.
