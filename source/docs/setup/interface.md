- Create, delete, and rename files and folders.
- Move files and folders with drag and drop.
- Use the context menu to explore all options.

#### OPEN EDITORS

At the top of the Explorer is a section labeled OPEN EDITORS. This is a list of active files or previews. These are files you previously opened in Lemonce that you're working on. For example, a file will be listed in the OPEN EDITORS section if you:

- Make a change to a file.
- Double-click a file's header.
- Double-click a file in the Explorer.
- Open a file that is not part of the current folder.

Just click an item in the OPEN EDITORS section, and it becomes active in Lemonce.

Once you are done with your task, you can remove files individually from the OPEN EDITORS section, or you can remove all files by using the View: Close All Editors or View: Close All Editors in Group actions.
