## Version 1.2.2 is in beta

Today we are happy to announce that Lemonce Editor releases version 1.2.2 beta.  

The new version adds a right click menu to webview, which is the section that 
display the testing page in the editor. There are 3 options available in the menu:
log element, click element, assert element. They do exactly what their name 
suggest.  

Before v1.2.2, it's pain to work with disabled or readonly element. With the 
new menu, it will be easier to work with those now.  

## news for version 1.3.0

We also have another good news for upcoming version 1.3.0. 
The new version is closer to beta right now and will ship with our new shiny 
driver. This driver is our JavaScript version of WebDriver, and is more 
sophiscated than WebDriver in many ways.  

## conclusion

The new beta version will be available for alpha testers only for now.
