Today we are happy to announce that Lemonce Editor releases version 2.0.0.  

Compared with the previous version 1, version 2 has three major changes below.
- Adopted a new version of the engine.
- Adopted the LemonceDriver which is more sophiscated than WebDriver in many ways. [more details](/feature/lcdriver.html)
- Changed the internal frame from Augular to Vue.

The new version is closer to beta right now and we will improve it gradually in the subsequent versions.
The UI of version 2 which has a big change compared with version 1 will be a whole new experience for you, but it will also help you to start your test more easily,especially for those who are used to VScode.
